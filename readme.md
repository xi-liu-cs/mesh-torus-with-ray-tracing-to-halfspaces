2022</br>
meshes are used to generate torus, sphere, cube, and polygons of intersected planes. meshes are represented by triangle strips. mesh editing algorithms such as glue_mesh concatenates the last vertex of array a with first vertex of array b, uv_mesh iteratively calls the shape_mesh_function that generates the vertex data (position, surface normal, and uv coordinates) for each u and v</br>
ray trace to second order surfaces such as cylinder, hyperboloid, sphere</br>
ray trace to halfspace surfaces, using different random number generators to generate polygon arrays that contain homogeneous form of halfspace descriptions of polygons</br>
noise is applied in various shapes using Perlin's noise algorithm</br>
